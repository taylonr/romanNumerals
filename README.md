# Roman Numerals

This repo is used for my talk `Everything I Needed to Know About Debugging I Learned in Elementary Physics`. There are two main branches `Problem` and `Solution`.

The slides are located in the `Presentation` folder on the `develop` branch.

Also, check out [my talks page](http://taylonr.com/talks/everything-i-needed-to-know-about-debugging-i-learned-in-elementary-physics/) as a video of the course will eventually be posted there.
